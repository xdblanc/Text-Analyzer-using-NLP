A broad range industrial consumer products use computers control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens remote controls included, factory devices like industrial robots computer-aided design, well general-purpose devices like personal computers mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power Internet, links billions computers users.

Early computers meant used calculations. Simple manual instruments like abacus aided people calculations since ancient times. Early Industrial Revolution, mechanical devices built automate long, tedious tasks, guiding patterns looms. More sophisticated electrical machines specialized analog calculations early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines developed World War II. The first semiconductor transistors late 1940s followed silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies late 1950s, leading microprocessor microcomputer revolution 1970s. The speed, power versatility computers increasing dramatically ever since then, transistor counts increasing rapid pace (as predicted Moore's law), leading Digital Revolution late 20th early 21st centuries.
