# Tokenize the text with the SpaCy pipeline. This segments the text into words, punctuation, and so on, using grammatical rules specific to the English language. 
# Count the number of times a word is used (not including stop words or punctuation), then normalize the count. A word thatâ€™s used more frequently has a higher normalized count.
# Calculate the sum of the normalized count for each sentence.
# Extract a percentage of the highest ranked sentences. These serve as our summary.
